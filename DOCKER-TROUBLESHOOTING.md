# VibePlayer Docker Build Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Build Issues and Solutions

### bcmath Extension Compilation Issues

The VibePlayer Docker image includes the PHP bcmath extension for mathematical operations. This guide addresses common compilation issues.

#### Issue: Slow bcmath Compilation

**Symptoms:**
- Docker build takes longer than expected
- Build appears to hang during PHP extension installation
- Compilation logs show extensive bcmath source file compilation

**Root Cause:**
The bcmath extension compiles multiple C source files during installation, which can be time-consuming on slower systems or limited CPU environments.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use Parallel Compilation (Implemented):**
   ```dockerfile
   # The Dockerfile now uses parallel compilation
   docker-php-ext-install -j$(nproc) bcmath
   ```

2. **Ensure Build Dependencies:**
   ```dockerfile
   # Required build tools are now included
   build-essential autoconf pkg-config
   ```

3. **Monitor Build Progress:**
   ```bash
   # Build with progress output
   docker build --progress=plain -t vibeplayer .
   ```

#### Issue: Missing Build Dependencies

**Symptoms:**
- Compilation errors during bcmath installation
- "make" or "gcc" command not found errors
- Configure script failures

**Solution:**
The Dockerfile now includes all required build dependencies:
- `build-essential` - GCC compiler and build tools
- `autoconf` - Autotools for configuration
- `pkg-config` - Package configuration tool

#### Issue: Memory or Resource Constraints

**Symptoms:**
- Docker build fails with out-of-memory errors
- System becomes unresponsive during build
- Build process killed unexpectedly

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase Docker Memory Limit:**
   ```bash
   # For Docker Desktop, increase memory allocation to 4GB+
   # For command line builds:
   docker build --memory=4g -t vibeplayer .
   ```

2. **Use Build Arguments for Resource Control:**
   ```bash
   # Limit parallel jobs if needed
   docker build --build-arg MAKEFLAGS="-j2" -t vibeplayer .
   ```

#### Issue: Network or Package Repository Problems

**Symptoms:**
- apt-get update failures
- Package download timeouts
- DNS resolution errors during build

**Solutions:**

1. **Use Alternative Package Mirrors:**
   ```dockerfile
   # Add to Dockerfile if needed
   RUN sed -i 's/deb.debian.org/mirror.example.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```

2. **Build with Network Debugging:**
   ```bash
   docker build --network=host -t vibeplayer .
   ```

### Build Optimization Tips

1. **Use Docker BuildKit:**
   ```bash
   export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
   docker build -t vibeplayer .
   ```

2. **Enable Build Cache:**
   ```bash
   docker build --cache-from vibeplayer:latest -t vibeplayer .
   ```

3. **Multi-stage Build (if needed in future):**
   ```dockerfile
   # Consider for larger applications
   FROM php:8.2-apache as builder
   # ... build steps ...
   FROM php:8.2-apache as runtime
   COPY --from=builder /compiled/extensions /usr/local/lib/php/extensions/
   ```

### Verification Steps

After a successful build, verify the bcmath extension:

1. **Check Extension Installation:**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm vibeplayer php -m | grep bcmath
   ```

2. **Test bcmath Functions:**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm vibeplayer php -r "echo bcadd('1.1', '2.2', 2);"
   ```

3. **Health Check:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:80 vibeplayer
   curl http://localhost:8000/?health
   ```

### Performance Benchmarks

Typical build times on different systems:
- **Local Development** (8 cores, 16GB RAM): ~20-25 seconds
- **GitHub Actions** (2 cores, 7GB RAM): ~45-60 seconds  
- **CI/CD Pipelines** (4 cores, 8GB RAM): ~30-40 seconds

### Support and Reporting

If build issues persist:

1. **Collect Build Logs:**
   ```bash
   docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t vibeplayer . 2>&1 | tee build.log
   ```

2. **System Information:**
   ```bash
   docker version
   docker info
   uname -a
   ```

3. **Report Issues:**
   - GitHub Issues: Include build logs and system information
   - Provide Docker version and host OS details
   - Mention any custom network or security configurations

### Version History

- **v2.0.0**: Added parallel compilation and build dependencies
- **v1.x**: Basic bcmath installation without optimization
