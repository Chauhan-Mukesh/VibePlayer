# NOTICE - Copyright and License Headers

This file provides templates for copyright and license headers that contributors should use when adding new files to the Vibe Player project.

## Standard Header Template

For **PHP files** (recommended for index.php and any new PHP files):

```php
<?php
/**
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
 * (c) 2025 Chauhan-Mukesh
 *
 * This file is part of Vibe Player.
 *
 * Vibe Player is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 * the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
 * (at your option) any later version.
 *
 * Vibe Player is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
 * GNU General Public License for more details.
 *
 * You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 * along with Vibe Player. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 */
```

For **JavaScript files**:

```javascript
/**
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
 * (c) 2025 Chauhan-Mukesh
 *
 * This file is part of Vibe Player.
 * See LICENSE file for full license text.
 */
```

For **CSS files**:

```css
/**
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
 * (c) 2025 Chauhan-Mukesh
 *
 * This file is part of Vibe Player.
 * See LICENSE file for full license text.
 */
```

For **HTML files**:

```html
<!--
SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
(c) 2025 Chauhan-Mukesh

This file is part of Vibe Player.
See LICENSE file for full license text.
-->
```

For **Markdown/Documentation files**:

```markdown
<!--
SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
(c) 2025 Chauhan-Mukesh
-->
```

For **Docker/Config files**:

```dockerfile
# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
# (c) 2025 Chauhan-Mukesh
```

## Contributor Instructions

### For New Contributors

When contributing new files, please:

1. **Use the appropriate header** from the templates above
2. **Replace the copyright year** with the current year if different
3. **Add your name** to the copyright line if you are the primary author:
   ```
   (c) 2025 YourName, Chauhan-Mukesh
   ```
4. **Keep the SPDX identifier** exactly as shown: `GPL-3.0-or-later`

### For Existing Files

When modifying existing files:

1. **Do not remove existing headers** unless specifically instructed
2. **You may add your copyright** if you make substantial contributions:
   ```php
   * (c) 2025 Chauhan-Mukesh
   * (c) 2025 YourName (modifications)
   ```
3. **Preserve the original SPDX identifier**

### For Documentation

- README files, API docs, and user guides typically don't need full headers
- For substantial documentation contributions, a simple comment header is sufficient:
  ```markdown
  <!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later -->
  ```

## Examples of Good Practice

### Example 1: New PHP utility file
```php
<?php
/**
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
 * (c) 2025 JohnDoe, Chauhan-Mukesh
 *
 * Video processing utilities for Vibe Player.
 * This file contains helper functions for video metadata extraction.
 */

function extractVideoMetadata($videoUrl) {
    // Implementation here...
}
```

### Example 2: New JavaScript module
```javascript
/**
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
 * (c) 2025 JaneSmith
 *
 * Player controls module for Vibe Player.
 * Handles play/pause, seeking, and volume controls.
 */

class PlayerControls {
    // Implementation here...
}
```

## Why These Headers Matter

1. **Legal Clarity**: Makes licensing terms clear for every file
2. **Attribution**: Ensures contributors get proper credit
3. **Compliance**: Meets GPL-3.0 requirements for source distribution
4. **Automation**: Enables automated license scanning and compliance tools
5. **Professional**: Follows industry best practices for open source projects

## Questions?

If you're unsure about:
- Which header to use for a specific file type
- Whether to add your copyright to an existing file
- How to handle files with mixed contributions

Please ask in the GitHub issue or discussion before submitting your PR.
